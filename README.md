## Overview

For this challenge, I utilized Tailwind CSS - it was my first time working with this framework and it greatly simplified the development process. Additionally, I implemented flexbox for layout purposes.


## My process

To start my project, I first added the necessary resources, including Tailwind CSS (a front-end framework), and then used various HTML tags to structure the design. I then applied Tailwind utility classes for styling the design. Finally, I addressed any issues that arose during development and completed the design.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS - For Styling the Markup


### What I learned

In my project, I learned about using different units such as rem, vh, and em in Tailwind to maintain responsiveness. This helped me create a design that looks good across different screen sizes and devices.


### Continued development

I'm going to use Tailwind css(Front-end framework), as I'm still learning Tailwind. This made Development work alot easier for me. Therefore, I'm looking forward to develop more projects using this Framework.
